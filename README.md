# Applied AI Capstone & Learning Projects

This repository contains high-level summaries of capstone and applied learning projects completed as part of a Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **structured problem-solving, applied learning, and delivery perspective**, rather than production-grade model development.

## Capstone Project

### Objective
Apply AI/ML concepts to a real-world problem in order to analyze data patterns and derive actionable insights that support business decision-making.

### Problem Context
The project focused on understanding a practical business or analytical problem, identifying relevant data, and framing an appropriate AI-driven approach to generate insights.

### High-Level Approach
- Defined and scoped the problem statement
- Reviewed and prepared the data for analysis
- Applied suitable AI/ML concepts based on the problem context
- Evaluated outcomes and interpreted results from a business perspective

### Key Outcomes
- Identified meaningful patterns and trends in the data
- Translated analytical findings into business-relevant insights
- Strengthened understanding of how AI initiatives are structured end-to-end

### Key Learnings
- Importance of problem definition and data quality
- Selecting the right analytical approach for a given problem
- Communicating AI-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders

## Applied Learning Projects

As part of the program, multiple applied learning exercises were completed to reinforce AI/ML fundamentals and real-world applicability.

### Areas Covered
- Supervised learning concepts
- Unsupervised learning concepts
- Model evaluation techniques
- Applied analytics and interpretation of results

### Learning Focus
- Understanding when and how to apply different AI techniques
- Evaluating model outputs at a conceptual level
- Interpreting results with a focus on business impact rather than algorithmic optimization

## Delivery Perspective

From a delivery and project management standpoint, this work emphasized:
- Translating problem statements into structured analytical tasks
- Managing ambiguity in data-driven initiatives
- Aligning analytical outcomes with stakeholder expectations
- Understanding dependencies between data, tooling, and delivery timelines

## Notes
This repository is intentionally high-level and does not include proprietary data, source code, or platform-specific implementations.

It is shared for **learning and demonstration purposes only**.
